      <strong id="beef"><h2>BEEF</h2></strong>
      <p style="background-color: orange;">
        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal
        muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is
        a source of protein and nutrients.[2] Most beef skeletal muscle meat can
        be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts,
        short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak,
        rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed
        (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually
        mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are
        ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties
        called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles
        and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum
        or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as
        sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a
        danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as
        mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull
        (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky
        Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but
        are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones
        are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is
        called veal. Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on
        economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from
        older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince
        (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may
        be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage
        in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or
        concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a
        ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

      <strong id="sushi"><h2>SUSHI</h2></strong>
      <p style="background-color: pink;">
        Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish
        of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar
        and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as
        seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation
        vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred
        to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1] Sushi is traditionally made
        with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice
        or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as
        squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types
        of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari),
        wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are
        popular garnishes for the dish. Sushi is sometimes confused with
        sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly
        sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
